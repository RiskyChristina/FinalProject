I decided to base this game off of DID, dissociative idenity disorder and give the player a point of view through someone who
deals with this mental health issue. There tends to be stigma build around this disorder due to media using it as an entertainment value.

My research behind this is through YouTube videos of interviews with people on DID, as well as previous knowledge and curiosity of the disorder
when I first learned about it. Unfortunately, a lot of the videos that first peaked my interest into this topic have since been deleted.

The text based game starts out with a short informative quiz on the some general knowledge of terms that are used within the game, as well as giving people
a chance to think about what DID is and learn about it before they go through the experience. 

Within the story are three alters that you will get the chance to meet. At a certain point in the game where you pick your outfit, this will trigger a switch to
happen between the alter egos. Once the outfit is picked the character Alice will go through a swtich that is stemed from stress. After she lays down and closes her eyes,
the story for Alice will end and the prompt will take you back to the start of the game. Depending on the outfit picked, it will open up one of the alters point of view
and the player will be able to play through their story line. This gives the chance for the player to experience what it is like to be three different people.

To unlock all three people, you will need to play as Alice twice and pick the outfit you didn't pick the first time.
